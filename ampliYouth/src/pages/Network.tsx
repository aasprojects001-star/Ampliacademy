            The AmpliYouth Network is a growing ecosystem of youth leaders,
            advocates, mentors, and partners connected through shared values,
            collective learning, and a commitment to ethical, community-driven
            change.

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            The Network exists to ensure that leadership development and
            advocacy do not end with a single program or event, but continue
            through sustained relationships, collaboration, and shared
            purpose across regions and contexts.

              Why the AmpliYouth Network Exists
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Many youth leadership initiatives struggle to sustain momentum
              after programs conclude. Participants often return to isolated
              contexts without ongoing support, peer learning, or access to
              platforms.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              The AmpliYouth Network addresses this gap by creating a
              decentralized yet connected community where members continue to
              learn, collaborate, and support one another beyond formal
              programming.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Through the Network, local action remains connected to a broader
              movement for justice, equity, and inclusive development.

          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The AmpliYouth Network is designed as a flexible, decentralized
