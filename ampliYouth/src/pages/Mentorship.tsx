            Mentorship is a central pillar of the AmpliYouth Advocacy Academy.
            We recognize that leadership potential flourishes best when young
            people are supported by guidance, experience, accountability, and
            trusted relationships.

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Our mentorship model is designed to go beyond advice-giving. It is
            a structured developmental process that supports personal growth,
            ethical leadership, advocacy effectiveness, and long-term impact.

              Why Mentorship Matters
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Across Africa and other underserved regions, young people often
              carry deep passion and commitment to change but lack access to
              guidance, role models, and strategic support.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Mentorship helps bridge this gap by offering lived experience,
              perspective, and practical wisdom that cannot be gained through
              training alone.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600">
              At AmpliYouth, mentorship is understood as a relationship of
              trust, learning, and shared responsibility for growth and impact.

            Our Mentorship Model
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The AmpliYouth Mentorship Program is structured around intentional
            matching, guided engagement, and continuous reflection. Each
            mentorship relationship is shaped by shared values and mutual
            commitment.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Mentorship engagements typically span several months and include
            goal-setting sessions, thematic discussions, progress reviews, and
            reflective exercises.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            While structured, the model remains flexible enough to respond to
            individual needs, contexts, and lived realities.
